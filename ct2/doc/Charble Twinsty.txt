Weapons:
Laser:
Lasers probably have an effective range of less than half a light second and a
linear dropoff of power.
+Low to medium damage
+Might do lots of damage to sensors, or certain sensors, or cause temporary blindness
+Hit instantly
+Infinite ammo
-Use energy
-Must hit precisely
-Damage decreases with range

Missile:
+Very high damage (a direct hit is generally a kill)
+Can be guided
+Can have proximity warheads or fragmentation damage
-Take time to travel
-Easy to see coming (active engines)
-Limited ammo
-Can be shot down
-Limited range/fuel capacity

Engine:
+V. powerful at close range
+Plentiful ammo/fuel
+Wide cone of effect
+Nice weapon of last resort
-Short range
-V. visible


Sensors:
Infra-red:
+Passive, can't be detected
+Takes little energy
-Only sees energy emissions (active engines, lasers, etc)
-Not very precise

Radar:
+Medium-long range 
+Wide area
+Moderately precise
-Active, can be detected by other radars
-Uses fair amount of energy

Lidar:
+Very long range
+Very precise
-Active, can be detected by other lidars
-Narrow angle, ~30 degree cone
-Uses quite a bit of energy

Eyeballs:
+Can see engine trails at long distance
+Probably can't be jammed (maybe by lasers or lidar-jammers...?)
-Can't see anything else

Probe:
Not really a sensor, but basically a missile with sensors attached to it.  It
zooms out, pings radar/lidar like mad until it gets destroyed.  It might
actually nicely double as a decoy, then.
They may not actually be incorperated in the game; oddball unbalancing factor.
+It gets shot, not you
+It finds the enemy
-Limited number
-Could announce your general direction


Defenses:
Armor:

Point-defense lasers:


Jammers:

Decoys:


Strategic factors:
Fuel:
You have a limited amount of fuel.  Probably enough for at least 10 minutes of
constant thrust, but it's still something you want to be careful of.  Fuel is
also fairly heavy, though the exact efficiency of your engines will depend on
gameplay.

Energy/heat:
I've decided to combine these since they really work the same way.  If you
have not enough energy or too much heat, you have to wait to recharge or cool
off.
Let's just call it energy, then.  Energy is used for sensors, weapons, and
countermeasures.  You have to both store it and generate it.  Generating
energy lights up infra-red sensors, which generally means you don't want to do
it much.

Missile ammunition:
You have a limited number of missiles.  They may well come in racks of 6, and
you might be able to fit up to 8 racks of them without TOO much trouble.
Still, make them count.

Max acceleration:
The maximum acceleration for a manned craft is 5-10 G's, or 50-100 meters per
second squared.  The maximum acceleration for unmanned missiles is between 10
and 50 times greater; Cold War era ICBM's could push 200 G's during boost.
