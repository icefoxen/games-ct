This is a game.  It is written in C++.  It exists mainly to learn C++ and the
Irrlicht engine, and find out if they are worth using for other things, or if
it's too painful.  It is called Charble Twinsty.

You have a space ship, you fly around, and you shoot things.  You might shoot
them with missiles or lasers.

It will have inertia and 6 degrees of freedom --more or less realistic
physics.  Hmmm.... QWEASD control lateral movement, IOPKL; control rotation,
space/alt/CMVN/enter/shift/tab/#'s as function keys...  That could be
interesting.
