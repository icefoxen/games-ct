I have used your game engine, and it is good.
However, it could be better.  Here's a few requests:
1) Make the keyboard event handling better.  Right now, to check whether a key
is pressed, you can use either SEvent.KeyInput.Char (and not be able to use
keys like F1 or Alt) or SEvent.KeyInput.Key (and not be able to use keys like
; and ]).  This is more than slightly horrible.  I advise you take a look at
the SDL keyboard interface; it's a good one.
2) Please, please, please make the internal string handling more consistant.
You have your own string class, woohoo.  You never seem to use it.  Sometimes
you use char* strings.  Sometimes you use wchar_t* strings.  Sometimes you can
get away with using the normal C++ std::string.  When can you use which?  I
dunno.  I just have to look at the docs and guess.  Pretty please make this
better.

Oh, and out of curiousity, why do you distribute the documentation as a .chm
file?  It seems like it does everything HTML can do, except it's more annoying
to read.  What if I want to work on my game over SSH (I do)?

Now that I've complained a lot, let me say that the game engine rocks.  It has
let me do more in a week than I would normally have been able to do in a
month, and it has taught me a lot about making 3D games.  Thank you.



XXX: #1, at least, I can probably fix myself...
